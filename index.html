            <h1>HTTPC</h1>
            <p>
                HTTPC is a heuristically developed C HTTP server. Reading
                through <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/">Beej's Guide to Networking</a>
                was a huge help to the socket stuff. Everything 
                else was mostly based on vibes I picked up from the HTTP protocol and
                a bit of late-night reading on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.
                Beyond that, I have absolutely no idea if the threading part
                is any good, or if it's slowly leaking memory somewhere, though
                memory usage looks steady. It's almost definitely not secure
                and should not be put online. Normally receiving requests over
                IPv6 should work, but I have not tested it, so... maybe don't
                bet your life on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you just read, this program is far from perfect, but I'd
                really like to make it a little better. It would be awesome to
                configure it through a file instead of a hardcoding everything.
                I'd also like to use a hashtable instead of a simple buffer for
                headers. The handling of supported extensions could use a bit of
                love so it doesn't feel so painfully hard-coded. Finally, I'd
                really love to play around with green threads, even if that's hardly
                related to the HTTP server itself.
